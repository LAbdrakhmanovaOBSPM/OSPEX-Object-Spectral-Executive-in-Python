# OSPEX-Object-Spectral-Executive-in-Python
Spectral Data Analysis Package for astrophysicists

Python version

Started in March 2019

OSPEX (Object Spectral Executive) is an object-oriented interface for X-ray spectral analysis of solar data written in IDL. 
Official source: https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssw/packages/spex/doc/ospex_explanation.htm

Our idea is to create the software similar to OSPEX which contains the same benefits or even more.

The work started as an internship project at LESIA, Observatory of Paris, France.

Weâ€™ll be happy to receive your feedbacks and suggestions.
