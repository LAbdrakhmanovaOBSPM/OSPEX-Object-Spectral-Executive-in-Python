Requirements to run OSPEX software

Tools: 
Python 3.6

Libraries: 
Astropy
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Tkinter

Following modules should come by default with Python after installation, but we recommend you to check if they work correctly. If not, please, import them manually:
Webbrowser
Datetime
Re
Copy
Importlib

To run:
Linux, Mac, Windows: When imported the libraries you should call main script from command line: python3 main.py
When the application opens, you can test it using .fits files from "Data" folder
To load the input data go to "File" menu bar, pick "Select Input" option
In new window, clicking on "Browse" widget, select desired file to analyse 

If you want to work with content and make modifications:

1. Go to the directory where your program is located:
cd directory location

2. Call Python:
python3

3. Upload file content from the plotting.py script :
from plotting import *

4. Choose desired file(s), "Data" folder:
File = Input(“filename.fits”)

Now you are able to call any parameters and functions of the .fits file

5. Some examples:
a) to load the parameter RATE from DATA:

File.rate

b) to plot Spectrum for Flux:

File.plot_spectrum_flux()

And etc.

Good luck!

Let us remind you that this software started as an internship project and will be improved and complemented
