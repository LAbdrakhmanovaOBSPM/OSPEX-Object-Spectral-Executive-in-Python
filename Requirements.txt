Requirements to run OSPEX software

Tools: 
Python 3.6

Libraries: 
Astropy
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Tkinter

Following modules should come by default with Python after installation, but we recommend you to check if they work correctly. If not, please, import them manually:
Webbrowser
Datetime
Re
Copy
Importlib

To run:
Linux, Mac, Windows: Afer importing the libraries you should call main script from command line: python3 main.py

If you want to work directly from command line:

1. Go to the directory where your program is located:
cd directory location

2. Call Python:
python3

3. Upload file content from the script plotting.py:
from plotting import *

4. Choose desired file(s). You can find the data to test in the Data folder:
File = Input(“filename.fits”)

Now you have the access to all parameters and functions of the .fits file

5. Some examples:
a) to load the parameter RATE from DATA:

File.rate

b) to plot Spectrum for Flux:

File.plot_spectrum_flux()

And etc.

Good luck!

Let us remind you that this software is an internship project and will be improved and complemented
