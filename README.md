# OSPEX-Object-Spectral-Executive-in-Python
Spectral Data Analysis Package for astrophysicists

Python version

This work started as an internship project at LESIA, Observatory of Paris in March 2019.

OSPEX (Object Spectral Executive) is an object-oriented interface for X-ray spectral analysis of solar data written in IDL.

Official source: https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssw/packages/spex/doc/ospex_explanation.htm

Our idea was to create the software similar to OSPEX using the benefits of Python language.

The software provides the toools to process the RHESSI data(Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager, NASA Small Explorer Mission).

In addition to this, further plans are to include observed data from the X-ray Spectrometer(STIX) aboard Solar Orbiter(launch date in February 2020).
